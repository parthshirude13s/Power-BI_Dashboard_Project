# Superstore Sales Project
# Problem Statement:
The goal was to create a comprehensive Super Store Sales Dashboard using Power BI that provides actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The dashboard aims to help stakeholders understand key sales metrics, identify top-selling products, analyze customer demographics, and spot sales trends across different regions and time periods. This helps the business in making data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, manage inventory efficiently, and improve profitability.

# Steps Followed:
1)Data Collection & Understanding:
Imported the Super Store sales data, which included sales, profit, customer details, product categories, and geographical information.
Reviewed the dataset to identify data fields, data types, missing values, and overall structure.
Data Cleaning & Transformation:

2)Removed duplicates and handled missing or inconsistent data.
Performed data transformations such as splitting columns, changing data types, and creating calculated columns/measures (e.g., Total Sales, Profit Margin) using DAX.
Established relationships between tables to build a data model that allows seamless data aggregation.

3)Data Modeling:
Created a star schema with Fact and Dimension tables for efficient data retrieval and better performance.
Established relationships between tables based on keys like Product ID, Customer ID, and Order ID.
Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation:

4)Designed interactive visualizations including:
Sales Analysis: Line charts, bar charts, and KPI indicators for sales trends, profit, and performance by category and sub-category.
Geographical Insights: Map visualizations to analyze sales by region and state.
Customer Insights: Customer segmentation using pie charts and tables to show purchase frequency, demographics, and order size.
Top Products: A table to showcase top-selling products and their contribution to overall sales.
Applied slicers and filters (e.g., date, category, region) to allow users to explore data dynamically.

5)Interactivity & User Experience:
Added interactive elements like drill-throughs, tooltips, and bookmarks for better data exploration.
Organized the dashboard layout to ensure itâ€™s user-friendly and intuitive, providing a seamless navigation experience.

6)Testing & Validation:
Validated the dashboard's functionality, data accuracy, and responsiveness.
Ensured all visuals responded correctly to slicers and filters.

7)Publishing & Sharing:
Published the dashboard to Power BI Service for sharing with stakeholders.
Set up access permissions and configured the dashboard for mobile view to ensure accessibility on various devices.
